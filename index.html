    <body>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funko">First, a quick history on the Funko company itself!</a>
        <p>In order to pay off my tuition for college, I must sell my prized collection of Funko POP! figures. 
            These figures are stylized collectibles of various characters from pop culture and otherwise. From Batman to Big Bird, I've got it all. 
            Since about 5 years ago I have collected nearly <b>300</b> of these figures. Of which I display them in the hallway to my bathroom. 
            They have come from all over the place, some from Universal Studios and some from eBay and it will be hard to say goodbye to my hard earned collection.But, my college education is overall more important than my collection. 
            It is with a heavy heart that I must sell my figures to get a good some of money to pay for my tuition. Iâ€™ll miss looking to my left from my desk to see all the colorful characters sitting over on their shelves. But eventually I <i>will</i> start collecting again. The collection will start to grow once more...  
</p>
    <br>
    <p>As far as the collection's worth, it has amassed to large sum of money. The retail value of them come in at about $13, and the older they are the more expensive they become. My most valuable one is listed at about $50 on multiple marketplaces online. When you go from just collecting these figures for fun to doing it to make money, you realize how much money you have in them. And even if anyone reading this wants them for their own collection I would be glad of that most of all! I hope someone gets some use out of them.</p>
